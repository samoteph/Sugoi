The project SUGOI is virtual console written in C#.
The console allows the creation of 16/8 bits games very quickly and in a fun way.
It is crossplateform, thanks to .net standard, but there is only one platform supported at this point : UWP.
With this player you can published game for Windows and XBOX.

The UWP Player is written with Win2D. The sound part is explained here :
