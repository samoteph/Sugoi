    //
    // If you guessed that it prints "a", "b", "c", you'd be wrong.
    // In fact, the output is "a", "c", "b".
    //
    // You may also be surprised to learn that the Debug.WriteLine call which prints "b"
    // will run on an arbitrary threadpool thread, not the game loop thread at all!
    //
    // What gives?
    //
    // CanvasAnimatedControl.RunOnGameLoopThreadAsync runs a single atomic operation on
    // the game loop thread. But when you pass it an async lambda, this is actually a
    // chain of continuation methods:
    //
    //  - The part up to the await Task.Delay (which prints "a") runs on the game loop thread
    //  - It registers the second part of the lambda to run later as an async continuation
    //  - It exits
    //  - At this point the task returned by RunOnGameLoopThreadAsync is signalled as complete
    //  - This unblocks the calling thread to complete its outer await and print "c"
    //  - Later, when Task.Delay completes, the await continuation is invoked
    //  - Because the game loop thread does not have a specialized SynchronizationContext,
    //    Debug.WriteLine("b") defaults to running on the threadpool.
    //
    // To run async methods which contain await operations on the game loop thread and have
    // them work the way we'd expect, we must provide our own SynchronizationContext that
    // knows how to invoke each async continuation back to the proper thread. This must also
    // take care to return a task that will complete only when the entire async chain has
    // finished, rather than as soon as the first await is reached.
    //
    // This helper allows us to write:
    //
    //      await GameLoopSynchronizationContext.RunOnGameLoopThreadAsync(animatedControl, async () =>
    //      {
    //          Debug.WriteLine("a");
    //          await Task.Delay(1000);
    //          Debug.WriteLine("b");
    //      });
    //      Debug.WriteLine("c");
    //
    // The output is "a", "b", "c", with both "a" and "b" written from the game loop thread.
